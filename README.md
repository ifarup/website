# website

This is the github repository for my personal website. It will be hosted both on [github pages](https://ifarup.github.io/website) and as my [personal profile](https://folk.ntnu.no/ivarfa/) at NTNU – Norwegian Univeristy of Science and Technology.

The website resides in the gh-pages branch.
